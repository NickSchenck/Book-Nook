### This site was created using what we have learned in the BootCamp Spot modules and BootCamp classes. We used the Google Books API (https://developers.google.com/books) to populate book information. We used the Cocktail DB API (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php) to populate drink information.
